![ü¶£](./mammoth.png)

I really don't want to make this theme. I just want things to look nice. But, ya know, my _specific_ type of nice.
Mammoth is a dark theme for the note-taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It's been designed and used primarily with, at most, 3 notes on screen.

## Features
‚úî Supports the [Todoist](https://github.com/jamiebrynes7/obsidian-todoist-plugin) plugin

‚úî Fun colors!

‚ùå Is an extinct mammal :(
